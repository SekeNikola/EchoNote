        id="ScopedStorage"
        severity="Warning"
        message="READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE is deprecated (and is not granted) when targeting Android 13+. If you need to query or interact with MediaStore or media files on the shared storage, you should instead use one or more new storage permissions: `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES`, `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO` or `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO`."
        category="Correctness"
        priority="8"
        summary="Affected by scoped storage"
        explanation="Scoped storage is enforced on Android 10+ (or Android 11+ if using `requestLegacyExternalStorage`). In particular, `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` will no longer provide write access to all files; it will provide the equivalent of `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` instead.&#xA;&#xA;As of Android 13, if you need to query or interact with MediaStore or media files on the shared storage, you should be using instead one or more new storage permissions:&#xA;* `android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES`&#xA;* `android.permission.READ_MEDIA_VIDEO`&#xA;* `android.permission.READ_MEDIA_AUDIO`&#xA;&#xA;and then add `maxSdkVersion=&quot;33&quot;` to the older permission. See the developer guide for how to do this: https://developer.android.com/about/versions/13/behavior-changes-13#granular-media-permissions&#xA;&#xA;The `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission can be used to manage all files, but it is rarely necessary and most apps on Google Play are not allowed to use it. Most apps should instead migrate to use scoped storage. To modify or delete files, apps should request write access from the user as described at https://goo.gle/android-mediastore-createwriterequest.&#xA;&#xA;To learn more, read these resources: Play policy: https://goo.gle/policy-storage-help Allowable use cases: https://goo.gle/policy-storage-usecases"
