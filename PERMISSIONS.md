## Permission Request Strategy

The app now requests permissions comprehensively with user-friendly explanations:

1. **On App Launch**:
   - Shows a beautiful permission rationale dialog explaining why each permission is needed
   - Users can choose to grant permissions immediately or defer for later
   - Version-aware permission requests (different permissions for different Android versions)

2. **Comprehensive Permission Set** (requested on first launch):
   - `RECORD_AUDIO` - for voice recording functionality
   - `CAMERA` - for photo capture and OCR processing  
   - `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` (Android 13+) or `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` (older versions) - for image access
   - `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO` (Android 13+) - for audio file access
   - `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO` (Android 13+) - for future video capabilities
   - `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` (Android 9 and below only) - for temporary file storage
   - `MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS` - for optimal audio recording quality
   - `VIBRATE` - for haptic feedback

3. **Runtime Permission Checks**:
   - Individual screens (like ImageCaptureScreen) perform additional permission checks
   - Graceful fallback when permissions are denied
   - Clear UI messaging about missing permissions

4. **User Experience**:
   - Beautiful permission rationale dialog with icons and explanations
   - Privacy protection notice
   - Non-blocking approach - users can still use available features
   - Option to request permissions later when needed

## Privacy Considerations

- **No sensitive data storage**: All processing is done through secure API calls
- **Temporary files**: Audio/image files are only temporarily stored for processing
- **No background recording**: Audio recording only happens when explicitly started by user
- **No location data**: App does not access or store location information
- **No contacts access**: App does not access user's contacts or personal information

## Version Compatibility

The permission model is designed to work across different Android versions:

- **Android 13+ (API 33+)**: Uses granular media permissions
- **Android 10-12 (API 29-32)**: Uses scoped storage with READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
- **Android 9- (API 28-)**: Uses traditional storage permissions with WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE

All permissions are requested at runtime with proper user consent dialogs.
